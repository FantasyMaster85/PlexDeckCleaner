This is a script for taking shows that are regularly watched and marking multiple episodes that aren't fully watched as completely watched, and making sure that the episodes for those shows don't appear on On Deck in the "Continue Watching" area.  It will also mark movies that are partially watched as fully watched (after user designated time).
